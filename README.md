# Data
The data used on this project is from the "fruits-360-original-size" folder.
It contains a total of 24 training folders containing around 100 images of fruits

# Script and Notebook
The script has been created so that it could work with any dataset of any size.
To have it work well, you have to adjust the settings in the file.
The output file is directly exported in csv format in AWS S3

# Environment
AWS S3
AWS EC2 ==> t2.medium used for testing purposes but there may be a need to use a "stronger" ec2 instance when dataset grows
